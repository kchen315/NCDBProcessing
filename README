Clean PUF

clean_puf is a function that given a .dat PUF file, returns the cleaned object. This code is adapted from the STATA/SPSS/SAS code that comes with a PUF file from the NCDB. PUF Files come from the NCDB as .dat files which are fixed-length columns with rows delimited by tab. This function is essentially the same as the SPSS/SAS/STATA code that comes with the PUF files from the NCDB. This function converts the 2016 NCDB .dat file into an R data frame with 136 variables.

Note that this will not work on earlier or later versions of the PUF because the column numbers and positions may be different.
